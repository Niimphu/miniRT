Vector

arrow with a direction. Declared with 3 vars x, y, z.

Addition

Just add each coordinate individualy (x1 + x2, y1 + y2, z1 + z2)

Subtraction

The vector subtraction of two vectors a and b is represented by a - b and it is nothing but adding the negative of vector b
to the vector a. i.e., a - b = a + (-b).
Thus, subtraction of vectors involves the addition of vectors and the negative of a vector.

How do i find a lenght of vector

if v is a vector 

Square root of x² + y² + z² = ||v||

Normalization

always has lenght 1. Usally used when only interested in direction

if v is a vector
v / ||v||

Dot product

u,v are vectors

u . v = ||u|| * ||v|| * cos(angle between u & v)

a sharp angle produces a big Dot product
at right angle dot product is 0!
if there oposite direction dot product is negative
mostly used to find the angle 

u.v =( x1 * x2) + (y1 * y2) + (z1 * z2)

Cross product

uxv= n * ||u|| * ||v|| * sin(angle between u & v)

n is a vector thats perpendicular to u and v. 
||n|| = 1 so its normal

can be found using right hand rule

u x v =
